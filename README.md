# Mathematics Flashcard Project
A Python-based project designed to help students master mathematical concepts through active recall.

## 🚀 Overview
This project was born out of my background in mathematics education. I wanted to create a structured way for learners to engage with complex formulas and logic. 

## 🛠 Tech Stack & Skills
- **Language:** Python
- **Tools:** GitHub for version control.
- **Key Concepts:** Logic structuring, user input handling, and data organization.

## 📈 Learning Objectives
Through this project, I practiced:
- Implementing clean, readable code.
- Using Git for regular commits and project management.
- Breaking down an educational need into a functional technical tool.

## 🔜 Future Improvements
- Adding a GUI (Graphical User Interface).
- Integrating a SQL database to track student progress over time.
