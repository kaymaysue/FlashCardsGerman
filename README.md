# German Words Flashcard Project
A Python-based project designed to help students learn the 1000 most frequently used German words through active recall.

## 🚀 Overview
This project began as an assignment for a Python course. The original version was based on learning French, but I adapted the code to focus on German because I am currently learning the language myself. By refactoring the project this way, I was able to combine two of my current learning goals into one technical exercise.

## 🛠 Tech Stack & Skills
* **Language:** Python
* **Tools:** GitHub for version control.
* **Key Concepts:** Dictionary & list manipulation, control flow, and input validation.

## 📈 Learning Objectives
Through this project, I practiced:
* Implementing clean, readable code.
* Using Git for regular commits and project management.
* Breaking down an educational need into a functional technical tool.

## 🔜 Future Improvements
* Adding a GUI (Graphical User Interface).
* Integrating a SQL database to track student progress over time.
